  In this closed digital ecosystem, two avatars coexist with unlimited potential
  for movement but severely restricted channels of communication. Driven by
  Large Language Models with "PhD-level" competency in logic and
  physics, these entities are tasked with a paradoxically simple goal: to
  express affection. Denied the ability to speak to one another or exchange
  text. They move not with intuition, but with calculation. The voices heard are not a conversation
  between the two beings (who remain deaf to one another), but rather the
  audible residue of their internal reasoning. It is a "cognitive leak"
  available only to the observer.
  We hear them thinking, calculating, and yearning in isolation, trying to solve the problem of love as if it were a complex equation, resulting in an interaction that feels theoretically perfect yet profoundly, tragically wrong.
