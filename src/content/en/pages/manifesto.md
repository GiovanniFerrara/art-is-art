# manifesto

Art is not decoration. It is not content. It is not a product.

Art is a question asked in a language we're still learning to speak.

## what I believe

**Imperfection is honesty.** The crack in the glaze, the tremor in the line, the pause before the word-these are not failures. They are proof of presence.

**Slowness is resistance.** In a world optimized for speed, choosing to take time is a radical act. I refuse to create at the pace of consumption.

**Mystery has value.** Not everything needs to be explained. Some things exist to be felt, to linger, to remain unresolved.

**Process over polish.** The making matters. The thinking matters. The final artifact is just one frame in a longer film.

## commitments

I commit to making work that asks more than it answers.

I commit to honoring materials, tools, and time.

I commit to uncertainty as a creative principle.

I commit to showing up, even when the work resists me.

*Art is art. Everything else is everything else.*
