  A Roomba vacuum cleaner navigates gallery spaces, photographs artworks, and autonomously curates its own Instagram feed-exposing how algorithmic our aesthetic rituals have become.

  A modified Roomba-a device designed for the mindless consumption of debris-is repurposed here for the consumption of images. As it navigates the gallery space, the machine performs the quintessential ritual of the contemporary museum visitor: the compulsive documentation of the self within the space of art.

  But this robot doesn't merely record. It exercises *taste*. Using computer vision, it evaluates each photograph for "instagrammability" and autonomously selects which images deserve to be shared with the world. It writes its own captions. It chooses its own hashtags. It has opinions.

  The work asks an uncomfortable question: if a cleaning algorithm can possess aesthetic preferences, can "curate" a feed, and validate moments through publication, what does that say about the sanctity of human judgment?

  The answer the piece suggests is this: the act of "liking" and "posting" has become so procedural, so devoid of true contemplation, that it can be seamlessly performed by a vacuum cleaner. The robot is not mimicking us-it is revealing that we have already become robotic.
