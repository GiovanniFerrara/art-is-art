# about

I'm Gian Marco Ferrara-an engineer who found art, or maybe art found me while I was debugging something else.

My path hasn't been linear. I've designed reinforced concrete structures and distributed software systems. I've brewed small batches of beer and made natural wine in Sicily. I've built roots in the volcanic soil of Southern Italy, formed connections in Warsaw, and now I'm based in Paris. Each transition taught me the same thing: creation is creation, whether you're pouring concrete or pouring yourself into code.

# signal from noise

In computer science, we spend enormous effort extracting signal from noise-finding the meaningful pattern buried in chaos. Art, I've come to believe, works the same way but in reverse: it *creates* signal that cuts through the noise of daily existence.

We live in an era of infinite content and zero attention. Everything is optimized, quantified, compressed into engagement metrics. My work asks: what happens when we turn those systems against themselves? When a vacuum cleaner becomes an art critic? When the algorithm is forced to have *taste*?

The answer isn't comfortable. It reveals how much of our own behavior has become algorithmic-how we scroll, like, share, and move on without ever truly *seeing*. The machine doesn't mock us. It mirrors us.

# chaos as method

I don't trust work that arrives fully formed. The interesting stuff happens in the gaps, the glitches, the moments when systems behave unexpectedly. I write code that makes art, and I make art that questions code. The boundary between the two has become productively blurry.

Sicily taught me that the best things ferment. Warsaw taught me that beauty survives brutalism. Paris taught me that you can take yourself seriously without losing your sense of humor.

# the work

My current practice sits at the intersection of robotics, artificial intelligence, and social media-not because these are trendy topics, but because they're the water we swim in. I want to make that water visible.

If a cleaning robot can develop aesthetic preferences, what does that say about the preferences we think are uniquely ours? If an algorithm can curate a feed, are we still the authors of our digital identity-or just another node in a network we didn't design?

These aren't rhetorical questions. I'm genuinely asking.
