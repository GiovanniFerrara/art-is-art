# about

I'm Gian Marco Ferrara, a multidisciplinary creative working at the intersection of art, design, and technology.

## background

Born with an insatiable curiosity for how things work and why they look the way they do. My practice spans digital art, visual design, and experimental media-always searching for that moment where craft meets meaning.

## process

I believe in slow work. In sitting with an idea until it reveals itself. Every project begins with observation, moves through experimentation, and arrives somewhere unexpected. The journey matters as much as the destination.

## currently

Based in the space between screens and sketchbooks. When not creating, I'm probably walking somewhere without a destination, reading something tangential, or staring at light.
