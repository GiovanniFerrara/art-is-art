GIAN MARCO FERRARA

AI engineer, artist and farmer born in Sicily in 1989.

His practice uses robotics and artificial intelligence to explore the boundary between human and algorithmic behavior. He builds machines that have opinions, systems that develop taste, robots that dance. Sometimes he also grows tomatoes.

In engineering, noise is the enemy. In art, noise is the message. He builds systems designed to behave according to their true dark machine nature - the glitch reveals what we've been trained not to see.
