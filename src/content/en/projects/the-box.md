  A subject's neural activity feeds an encrypted process. From a black cube in the center of the room, sounds emerge. What happens in between remains obscure.

  A subject sits beneath a single light. Around their head, a device reads the electromagnetic waves of their brain. In the center of the room, a black cube. From inside comes a strange metallic noise-something between music and mechanism. Between the two, a process transforms neural activity into sound. It is not shown. It is not explained. What happens in between is completely obscure.

  We have entered the era of *functional faith*. We feed data into systems whose internal reasoning we entirely ignore. We accept the output because it appears coherent.

  *The BOX* makes this void physical. Neural telemetry enters one side of an opaque process. Does the signal flow from the participant to the machine, or the other way around? The black box between them swallows every attempt to distinguish cause from effect.

  Those watching believe they are outside the loop. The presence of an audience influences the room, the room influences the mind, the mind feeds the void that alters the sound the cube produces, the sound closes the cycle. No one here truly knows what they are witnessing.
