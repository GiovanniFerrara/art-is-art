  A subject's neural activity is fed into a sealed algorithmic process that drives a kinetic sculpture-exposing the void of translation between human signal and machine response.
description: >-
  A subject sits beneath a single light. Around their head, a device reads the electrical surface of thought. In the center of the room, a black cube waits. Between the two-between signal and motion-there is a process. It is not displayed. It is not explained. What it does with the data it receives is entirely its own.

  We have entered an era of *functional faith*. We feed data into systems whose internal reasoning we will never inspect. We accept the output because the output appears coherent. The input was ours. The output seems responsive. And so we trust the void between them.

  *The BOX* makes this void physical. Neural telemetry enters one end of an opaque process. Kinetic response exits the other. The audience is positioned exactly where society now permanently stands: watching inputs they can identify and outputs they can perceive, with no access whatsoever to the transformation between them.

  The subject does not choose to move the cube. The device reads, the process runs, the metal responds-but the word *responds* already assumes a direction no one in the room can verify. Does the neural signal drive the sculpture, or does the sculpture's presence reshape the signal? The link between skull and steel runs both ways, and the black box between them swallows every attempt to tell which end is cause and which is effect.

  The audience watches from outside this loop, believing themselves observers. But observation is participation. Their presence alters the room, the room alters the mind, the mind feeds the void that moves the cube. No one here is innocent of the output. No one here can claim to know what they are witnessing.
