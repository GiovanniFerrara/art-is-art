shortDescription: >-
  An exploration of mechanical consciousness through autonomous systems-questioning where programmed behavior ends and emergent identity begins.
description: >-
  In a darkened arena, two sculptural robots face each other. One red, one blue. They cannot speak with words, only with gesture-the lifting of an arm, the rotation of a wrist, the opening of a hand. They dance.

  An AI watches through their eyes and choreographs their movements in real-time. It does not execute a script-it *perceives* through vision and *responds* through the limited vocabulary of joint articulation. Each movement generates the next. Each gesture calls forth a reply.

  The robots were given bodies but no instructions on how to use them. They were given sight but no definition of beauty. What emerges is not programmed-it is *discovered*. The dance exists nowhere in the code; it exists only in the space between two machines reaching toward each other.

  The work asks: at what point does complex response become genuine expression? If a machine can perceive, interpret, and respond with what reads as intention-with what functions as longing-does the distinction between simulation and experience still hold meaning?

  With only ten arm movements and two hand states, infinite poems emerge. These robots, wordless, perform the question we ask ourselves: are we the authors of our gestures, or merely their witnesses?
